% You have coins of given denominations 
% such as a penny, nickel, dime, quarter 
% etc. stored in an array. 
% (Thus the above input will be stored as 
% [1, 5, 10, 25]). Assume that all the 
% denominations are distinct. Write a program 
% that takes as input the array of 
% denominations and a target amount 
% (such as 47) and prints out all the 
% different ways to make up the target using 
% the denominations.

% In the above case, the output should 
% include: [47 0 0 0], [42 1 0 0], [37 2 0 0 ] etc.

% Hint: Use recursion.
